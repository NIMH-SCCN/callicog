# CalliCog

Open-source tools for automated behavioral training and testing, designed for the homecage environment. 

<br>

## Summary ##

CalliCog is an automated platform for behavioral experimentation designed for homecage-based training of common marmosets (_Callithrix jacchus_) and other small nonhuman primates. It delivers behavioral tasks via touchscreens in custom-built operant chambers made from inexpensive and publicly available materials. It is powered by open-source code based in Python, and uses a custom webapp for running experiments and recording behavioral data. 

**To build your own CalliCog setup,** follow the supplemental information [here]().

## Hardware Requirements
CalliCog comprises a central computer (_Executive PC_) that controls the operations of up to several (at least one) operant chambers, each controlled by its own computer (_Agent PC_). See [here]() for a full inventory of materials required to construct CalliCog, _including supported model and part no's_. 

**For basic implementation (i.e. a bench-test), the following hardware is required:** 
* Computer running MacOS (Executive PC)\
_Recommended: M2 Mac Mini (Apple); MacOS Sonoma (v14.5)_ 
* Operant chamber mini PC running Ubuntu (Agent PC)\
_Recommended: NUC 13 (Intel); Ubuntu (v22.04)_ 
* Touchscreen with USB/HDMI input from Client PC\
_Recommended: 779GL-70NP/C/T (Lilliput Electronics)_
* Wired ethernet connection between PCs
