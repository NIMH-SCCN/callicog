# CalliCog

Open-source tools for automated behavioral training and testing, designed for the homecage environment. 

## Summary ##

CalliCog is an automated platform for behavioral experimentation designed for homecage-based training of common marmosets (_Callithrix jacchus_) and other small nonhuman primates.

CalliCog uses a computer connected to custom-built operant chambers made from inexpensive and publicly available materials. It runs on open-source code based in Python, and uses a custom webapp for running experiments and recording behavioral data.
